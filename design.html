        <h2> CMYK Designathon Wall Mock-Up </h2>
        <p> My team and I placed 3rd with our design for 1951's Community Wall ask. We chose to focus on the visualization and reinforcement of community with our design while also capitalizing on the interactivity and virality of photo opportunities in our visual world. </p>
